You should try to connect with Cisco Anyconnect which you can get from http://www.vpnc.towson.edu
You would type in vpnc.towson.edu and then login with your towson login

or

Use the vpn.sh script like 
./vpn.sh vpnc.towson.edu 
Then login with your towson login

Now you are connected to tu-secure which is needed to connect to the server
